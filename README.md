# Go REST

Teaching myself how to use Golang to make a REST API using gin.

Currently spits out random quotes from a couple of authors just based off of a static json file because this is about learning to use Go and a Go router (gin) rather than interacting with a database.
Runs with ```run go ./server.go``` and serves on "/", "/perlman", and "/camatte" at the moment.
